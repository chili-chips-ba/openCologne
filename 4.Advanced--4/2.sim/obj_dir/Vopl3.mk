# Verilated -*- Makefile -*-
# DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Makefile for building Verilated archive or executable
#
# Execute this makefile from the object directory:
#    make -f Vopl3.mk

default: Vopl3

### Constants...
# Perl executable (from $PERL)
PERL = perl
# Path to Verilator kit (from $VERILATOR_ROOT)

# SystemC include directory with systemc.h (from $SYSTEMC_INCLUDE)
SYSTEMC_INCLUDE ?= 
# SystemC library directory with libsystemc.a (from $SYSTEMC_LIBDIR)
SYSTEMC_LIBDIR ?= 

### Switches...
# SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
VM_SC = 0
# Legacy or SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
VM_SP_OR_SC = $(VM_SC)
# Deprecated
VM_PCLI = 1
# Deprecated: SystemC architecture to find link library path (from $SYSTEMC_ARCH)
VM_SC_TARGET_ARCH = linux

### Vars...
# Design prefix (from --prefix)
