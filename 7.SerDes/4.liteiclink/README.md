## Workflow Overview
First, letâ€™s dive into the 4.liteiclink folder and walk through its structure so you can see how each component fits together and how the overall build process comes together

### 2.sw

In the [2.sw](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/2.sw) is a modified version of the [LiteX Demo Application](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/tree/master/litex/soc/software/demo) that will include generated csr from the migen targer file in the `main.c` function. There lie the control function for the datapath in bare-metal C.
The uart console is built upon the official demo application. 

### 3.build

Here in the [3.build]([https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/uberClock/tree/main/2.soc-litex/3.build](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/3.build)) folder we have the [Makefile](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/3.build/Makefile) that tries to ease the LiteX workflow into different parts. Running `make help` gives pretty self-exmplanatory commands:

```
$ make help
Usage:
  make open-target    file=<name>
  make open-example   file=<proj>
  make build-board    [FREQ=..] [OPTIONS='..']
  make load           [FREQ=..] [OPTIONS='..']
  make term                [PORT=..]
  make build-sw            [DEMO_FLAGS='..']
  make sim
  make view-sim
  make clean-sim
  make setup-ethernet      [ETH_IFACE=..] [STATIC_IP=..]
  make start-server
  make stop-server
  make litescope
  make clean
  make copy-migen
```

The most important ones are:

* `make build-board` which runs the build process using Vivado(later openXC7 will be used instead). The command has parameters `FREQ` and `OPTIONS` which can be overloaded, but running it without any parameters is going to include `--with-etherbone` and `--with-uberclock` with a frequency of `65MHz`.

* `make build-sw` which compiles the bare-metal C application. The imporant note to add is to run the command after the build finishes because the compiler depends of the generated files in the `3.build/build` folder.

* `make load` simply loads the bitstream onto the FPGA via the JTAG programmer
  
* `make term` opens up the serial console in the terminal to control the datapth signals. The default port is `/dev/ttyUSB0` while that can be simply changed with `PORT`.

**NOTE**: Run `make term` in a seperate terminal before running `make load`

### 4.migen
The [4.migen](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/4.migen) folder contains two subfolders:
* [liteiclink](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/4.migen/liteiclink/serdes) which has the file that should be copied in the liteiclink litex folder
* [litex_boards](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/4.migen/litex/litex-boards/litex_boards) which has:
  [platforms](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/4.migen/litex/litex-boards/litex_boards/platforms) which has the specific platform file that specifies the pins of the board
  [targets](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/tree/main/7.SerDes/4.liteiclink/4.migen/litex/litex-boards/litex_boards/targets) has the target file that specifies all of the important parts of the CPU design and instantiates the SoC.

**NOTE**: Right now you need to copy these subfolders with the files manually in your LiteX installation folder in `litex/litex_board/litex-boards`.
