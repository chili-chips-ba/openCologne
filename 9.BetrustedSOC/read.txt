Port the barebones of BetrustedSOC to GateMate, namely only VexRiscv CPU and UART. We view this as the stepping stone for the next NLnet project with Cologne Chip, perhaps using one of their yet to be released 40K or 80K LUT devices. It's worth noting that BetrustedSOC is hosted in a Spartan7 (XC7S50), which is a 50K LUT6 device, 80% utilized as of October 2022. The native BetrustedSOC is implemented using proprietary Vivado 2019.2 toolchain, and also employs a 5K LUT4 Lattice UP5 FPGA for housekeeping tasks. The full BetrustedSOC would be a very nice and interesting thing to do. However, given its complexity, it's a project of its own. Our WP9 is merely to test the waters and set the stage for a yet to be defined follow-on project dedicated to BetrustedSOC. The idea is that by then, thanks to work on this project, Cologne tools will be sufficiently improved to eliminate their current choke point at cca 20% max utilization. Within this work package, we also plan to create a comprehensive blog that describes all FPGA/RTL developed for the project.
